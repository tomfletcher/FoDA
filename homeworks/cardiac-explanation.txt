GENERAL EXPLANATION OF THE STUDY
================================
This data is from a study that was trying to determine if a drug called 
"dobutamine" could be used effectively in a test for measuring a 
patient's risk of having a heart attack, or "cardiac event."  For younger 
patients, a typical test of this risk is called "Stress Echocardiography." 
It involves raising the patient's heart rate by exercise--often by having
the patient run on a treadmill--and then taking various measurements, such 
as heart rate and blood pressure, as well as more complicated 
measurements of the heart.  The problem with this test is that it often 
cannot be used on older patients whose bodies can't take the stress of hard 
exercise.  The key to assessing risk, however, is putting stress on the heart 
before taking the relevant measurements.  While exercise can't be used to 
create this stress for older patients, the drug dobutamine can. This study, 
then, was partly an attempt to see if the stress echocardiography test was 
still effective in predicting cardiac events when the stress on the heart 
was produced by dobutamine instead of exercise. More specifically, though,
the study sought to pinpoint which measurements taken during the 
stress echocardiography test were most helpful in predicting whether or not
a patient suffered a cardiac event over the next year. The complete
citation for the journal in which the results of the study were published
is as follows:

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DATA          
=============================
The accompanying data file contains the complete data for the final
study population, which included 220 men and 338 women. The data collected
on each subject is explained below.

HOW TO USE THE DATA FILE
========================
The actual data file is a comma delimited text file. The first row contains
the abbreviations for the information recorded on each subject. The remaining 
rows each represent a single patient's corresponding information. 

For the purposes of the study, the "cardiac events" that the "Dobutamine
Stress Echocardiography" was attempting to predict were broken down into 
four categories:
        
   CARDIAC EVENTS: (1) myocardial infarction (MI)
                   (2) revascularization by percutaneous transluminal
                       coronary angioplasty (PTCA)
                   (3) coronary artery bypass grafting surgery (CABG) 
                   (4) cardiac death

If you're not familiar with medical jargon, you can simply think of these 
as four things that can go wrong with your heart, and that the test was 
trying to predict. In the datafile you can see whether or not a patient 
suffered one of these cardiac events in the year following the patient's
test by looking in the columns marked "newMI", "newPTCA", "newCABG", and
"death".  Note that, contrary to statistical convention, a "1" means that 
the patient DID NOT suffer the corresponding cardiac event, and a "0" means
that he DID. 

The other variables are explained below.
